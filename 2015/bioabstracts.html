            <p><small class="gen">Abstract： Software quality is important for the success of software projects. Although a range of measures have been taken to assure software quality, in reality released software systems still contain bugs. For a large and popular software system, the project team could receive a large number of bug reports. In this talk, I will briefly introduce some of my work on effective management of software bugs, such as bug localization, bug-fixing time prediction, and bug-proneness prediction. These methods are developed using software analytics techniques, which mine actionable knowledge from large-scale software engineering data. </small></p>

          Title: Maximizing Precise Race Detection<br />
<br />
Abstract: Data races are an important class of concurrency bugs that have caused some of the worst concurrency problems in multithreaded systems today. Existing techniques for detecting data races either have limited detection power or are prone to false alarms. In this talk, I will present our recent work on maximal race detection, a technique that achieves the maximal precise race detection power, that is, 1) every race it detects is real, and 2) it detects all the possible races that can be detected by any precise technique given the same information. The technique is both theoretically sound and practically useful. It scales to real world large complex systems and has found new serious races in programs such as Eclipse. </p>

Title: Workflow Temporal Verification: An Efficient and Effective Approach for Delivering On-Time Completion </small></p>
            <p><small class="gen">Abstract: On-time completion is one of the most important QoS requirements for workflow applications, and workflow temporal verification is the major approach for delivering on-time completion. A general temporal verification framework is composed of three basic components including temporal constraint setting, temporal consistency monitoring, and temporal violation handling. In this talk, I will briefly go through these basic components, present the work we have done in the scientific workflow area, and introduce some of our latest progress in the business workflow area. </small></p>

            Title: Towards Constructing New Attributes for Software Engineering Tasks by Crowdsourcing </small></p>
            <p><small class="gen">Abstract:　In Mining Software Engineering Data (MSED), a large number of Software Engineering (SE) tasks are transformed into data mining problems for solving. Attributes constructed from SE data heavily impact the solving of SE tasks. However, no systematic investigation has been conducted on the methods of constructing attributes in MSED. In this study, we report our attempt towards constructing new attributes for SE tasks by crowdsourcing. In this new method, namely Attribute Construction by Crowdsourcing (ACC), a quantity of volunteers are employed to manually accomplish a SE task in MSED and submit the reasons in making their decisions during the process. With these reasons, new attributes for this SE task can be effectively constructed under the guidance of some Heuristic Construction Rules (HCRs). To facilitate this new method, we implement a tool named Crowdsourcing SE Platform (CSEP). With CSEP, we validate our new method on two typical SE tasks as case studies, namely duplicate bug report detection and bug report summarization. In our experiments, we employ 23 volunteers and 21 volunteers, and successfully construct 19 attributes and 11 attributes for these two tasks respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our work provides a practicable approach to construct new attributes for solving SE tasks. For both case studies, data mining algorithms with new attributes by ACC consistently outperform the comparative ones</small><small class="gen"><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/hongyujohn></a></small><span class="gen"><big

              Title: Towards building high confidence transportation software on big data<br />
  <br />
            Abstract: High confidence is a critical quality for the mobile transportation software.  Take &quot;Chelaile&quot; for instance, it provides users with real time information about the bus-bus stop distances, and inaccurate distance information may cause users to miss the bus, and further give up the software, so the accuracy of distance information directly affects the user experience, and further confidence of users to the software.  However,  it's challenging to ensure the accuracy of distance estimation, given raw data, such as the bus GPS data,  and the bus routes, usually includes a lot of noisy data or wrong data which is even worse.  In this session, the presenter will introduce the engineering process and technical solution to improve the data quality by mining the big data collected from the buses and user logs. Finally, some potential research topics are introduced.</p>

              Title: Search-Based Inference of Polynomial Metamorphic Relations   </big></span></p>
            <p><span

              class="gen"><big class="gen">Abstract:  Metamorphic testing (MT) is an effective methodology for testing those so-called “non-testable” programs (e.g., scientific programs), where it is sometimes very difficult for testers to know whether the outputs are correct. In metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (MRs) (which specify how particular changes to the input of the program under test would change the output) play an essential role. However, testers may typically have to obtain MRs manually. In this talk, I will present our recent work in ASE 2014, which is a search-based approach to automatic inference of polynomial MRs for a program under test. In particular, we use a set of parameters to represent a particular class of MRs, which we refer to as polynomial MRs, and turn the problem of inferring MRs into a problem of searching for suitable values of the parameters. We then dynamically analyze multiple executions of the program, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the search problem. To improve the quality of inferred MRs, we further use MR filtering to remove some inferred MRs. We also conducted three empirical studies to evaluate our approach using four scientific libraries (including 189 scientific functions). From our empirical results, our approach is able to infer many high-quality MRs in acceptable time (i.e., from 9.87 seconds to 1231.16 seconds), which are effective in detecting faults with no false detection.</big></span></p>

            <p><span

              class="gen"><big class="gen">Abstract: Mobile devices become indispensable in our daily life and work. People are used to accessing online Web services via mobile devices, either from native apps or web apps. Despite the cross-platform portability, current web apps can provide comparable features with native apps by employing advanced Web technologies like HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. However, it is well-known that web apps are poor in performance. In this talk, we will review the history of web-based software paradigm shift from Browser-Server to Mobile-Cloud, and analyze the big challenges for web apps under mobile computing context. Then we provide an approach for retrofitting web apps with a new programming abstraction. Around the programming abstraction, we realize a set of cloud-based services, including computation offloading, data offloading, and collaborative cache. We currently refactor Chromium browser to accommodate web apps with optimized performance and energy cost.</big></span><br />

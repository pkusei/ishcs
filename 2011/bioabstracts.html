              <br />
              Abstract: The advances of wireless and device technologies have
              led to seamless integration of physical objects that are connected
              using wireless networks. Examples of physical objects include
              sensors, Radio Frequency Identification tags, and transceivers
              that obtain geographical location information. Physical computing
              systems are applications that built upon these physical objects
              which intercepts real-time information of their environment. The
              information can be used by physical computing systems to adapt
              their behavior. However,construction of dependable physical
              computing systems poses new challenges such as sensing ranges,
              power-awareness, computational models, and object mobility.These
              challenges bring interesting research opportunities to program
              analysis,testing, modeling and verification. In this talk, we will
              introduce several emerging physical computing systems, review
              major challenges and discuss preliminary efforts. <br />

              Software Evolution   [<a href="bitrans-ishcs11.pdf">Slides</a>]<br />
              <br />
              Abstract: Model transformations are a key element in the OMG's
              Model Driven Development agenda, providing a standard way to
              represent and transform software artifacts such as requirements,
              design models, program code, tests, configuration files, and
              documentation in software development. However, after a
              transformation is applied, the source and the target models
              usually co-exist and evolve independently. How to propagate
              modifications correctly across models in different formats and
              guarantee system consistency remains as a big challenge. In this
              talk, I will show that well-behaved bidirectional model
              transformations play an important role in making software
              evolution be more robust and trusty, and demonstrate how the
              bidirectional transformation system GRoundTram can be effectively
              used for developing evolutionary software with high confidence.  <br />

              Abstract: Internet is becoming an open, global, ubiquitous and
              smarter computer for our society and planet. Such “Internet as a
              Computer” requires substantial improvements in software
              characteristics such as collaborative, situational, emergent,
              autonomous, evolvable and high confidence, which challenge
              existing software paradigms, including software model, software
              middleware and engineering approach. In this talk, a new software
              paradigm, called Internetware, is presented to enable software
              running on the Internet to have those characteristics.<br />

              Title: Service Reliability Engineering: Performance Evaluation,
              Fault Tolerance, and Reliability Prediction  <br />
              <br />
              Abstract: Service-oriented systems are becoming prevalent nowadays
              and they have been widely used in e-business, e-government,
              automotive systems, multimedia services, process control, finance,
              and also a lot of other domains. The trend towards large-scale
              complex service-oriented systems makes developing fault-free
              systems a great challenge. In the service-oriented environment,
              most of the traditional software reliability engineering
              techniques face new challenges caused by the immense degree of
              heterogeneity of Web services, the vastly unpredictable Internet
              environment, and the fact that the remote service components are
              provided and hosted by other organizations. In this talk, we will
              discuss various service reliability engineering techniques,
              including performance evaluation, fault tolerance, and reliability
              prediction. Firstly, to obtain performance of different Web
              services, we conduct real-world service-oriented system
              evaluations. Based on the performance information of Web services,
              fault tolerance can be achieved by employing functionally
              equivalent Web services readily offered by different service
              providers. Finally, a new paradigm for service reliability
              prediction is proposed to facilitate the development of
              predictably reliable service-oriented systems.  <br />

              <br />
              Abstract: Ubiquitous computing systems are rapidly entering the
              mainstream for large numbers of computer users, but their design
              and dependability are often poor.  In this talk I will give an
              overview of some of the challenges of designing high-confidence
              ubiquitous computing systems, and I will describe some recent
              research on automated fault identification for ubiquitous
              computing systems that accounts for their context-aware and
              adaptive character.  In particular, the behavior of a
              context-aware, adaptive application (CAAA) is governed strongly by
              changes in its execution "context", which are phenomena that arise
              locally on the device on which it is deployed (such as a reduction
              in battery level, or an increase in CPU utilization) or externally
              in the environment of the device (such as a change in location
              sensed via GPS, or the arrival of another nearby device sensed via
              Bluetooth).  Changes in context trigger adaptations in the CAAA to
              engage alternative modes of processing appropriate to the new
              context.  The adaptation behavior of typical CAAAs is implemented
              via a set of rules, and even a simple set of rules can induce very
              complex forms of adaptation.  Our research involves deriving an
              Adaptation Finite-State Machine (A-FSM) from a set of adaptation
              rules and then analyzing the state space of the A-FSM to identify
              occurrences of predefined fault classes.  I will describe the
              analysis algorithms we have developed, and I will present results
              from case studies we have performed.  Our primary case study
              subject is an application called PhoneAdapter that is
              representative of typical CAAAs and that automatically adapts a
              user's phone profile to changes in location, speed and work
              schedule.  I will conclude with a discussion of future research
              directions.<br />

              Title: Making OS Kernels Crash-Proof by Design and Certification<br />
              <br />
              Abstract: Operating System (OS) kernels form the bedrock of all
              system software. They can have the greatest impact on the
              resilience,security, and extensibility of today's computing
              hosts.  A single kernel bug can wreck the entire system's
              integrity and protection. Recently, members of my research group
              at Yale have been applying new advances in certified software to
              the design and development of novel kernel structures that
              generalize and unify traditional OS abstractions in microkernels,
              recursive virtual machines, and hypervisors.  By replacing the
              traditional ``red line''(between the kernel and user code) with
              customized safety policies, we intend to support different
              isolation and kernel extension mechanisms in a single framework.
              We are also building a new framework for certified kernel
              programming and a set of domain-specific variants of C-like
              languages. Certified kernels built under this project will offer
              safe and application-specific extensibility and provable security
              properties with information flow control. In this talk I will give
              an overview of this project and report some of our recent
              advances.<br />

                Applications   [<a href="security-ishcs11.pdf">Slides</a>]<br />
              </p>
              <p>Abstract: Access control vulnerabilities are among the most
                dangerous for web applications, many of which are susceptible to
                access control attacks. Because in practice access control
                policies are rarely explicitly specified and are
                application-specific, detecting this type of errors is
                difficult.  In this talk, I will describe a novel,practical
                static analysis to detect access control vulnerabilities. At the
                core of this analysis is a technique that statically infers and
                enforces implicit access control assumptions. Our key insight is
                that source code implicitly documents intended accesses of each
                role and any successful forced browsing to a privileged page is
                likely a vulnerability. Our analysis constructs sitemaps for
                different roles in a web application, compares per-role sitemaps
                to find privileged pages, and checks whether forced browsing is
                successful for each privileged page. Evaluation results on
                several real-world web applications show that our technique is
                effective---it is scalable and detects both known and new access
                control vulnerabilities with few false positives.</p>

              Title: Automating Test Automation  [Slides]<br />
              <br />
              Abstract: Mention “test case”, and it conjures up image of a
              script or a program that exercises a system under test. In
              industrial practice, however, test cases often start out as steps
              described in natural language. These are essentially directions a
              human tester needs to follow to interact with an application,
              exercising a given scenario. Since tests need to be executed
              repeatedly, such manual tests then have to go through test
              automation to create scripts or programs out of them. Test
              automation can be expensive in programmer time. We describe a
              technique to automate test automation. The input to our technique
              is a sequence of steps written in natural language, and the output
              is a sequence of procedure calls with accompanying parameters that
              can drive the application without human intervention. The
              technique is based on looking at the natural language test steps
              as consisting of segments that describe actions on targets, except
              that there can be ambiguity in the action itself, in the order in
              which segments occur, and in the specification of the target of
              the action. The technique resolves this ambiguity by backtracking,
              until it can synthesize a successful sequence of calls. We present
              an evaluation of our technique on professionally created manual
              test cases for two open-source web applications as well as a
              proprietary enterprise application. Our technique could automate
              over 82% of the steps contained in these test cases with no human
              intervention, indicating that the technique can reduce the cost of
              test automation quite effectively.<br />

                Abstract: Tool automation to reduce manual effort has been an
                active research area in various subfields of software
                engineering such as software testing and analysis. To maximize
                the value of software testing and analysis, effective support
                for cooperation between engineers and tools is greatly needed
                and yet lacking in state-of-the-art research and practice. In
                particular, testing and analysis practice is in a great need of
                (1) effective ways for engineers to communicate their
                testing/analysis goals and guidance to tools and (2) tools with
                strong enough capabilities to accomplish the given
                testing/analysis goals and with effective ways to communicate
                challenges faced by them to engineers -- enabling a feedback
                loop between engineers and tools to refine and accomplish the
                testing/analysis goals. In addition, different tools have their
                respective strengths and weaknesses, and there is also a great
                need of allowing these tools to cooperate with each other.
                Similarly, there is a great need of allowing engineers (or even
                users) to cooperate to help tools such as in the form of
                crowdsourcing. A new research frontier on synergistic
                cooperations between human and tools, tools and tools, and human
                and human is yet to be explored. We have recently proposed the
                methodology of cooperative developer testing as initial work in
                this direction (e.g., Covana described in an ICSE 2011 paper).
                This talk presents recent advances and future trends towards
                cooperative testing and analysis.<br />

                Abstract: Cloud computing is a latest market-oriented computing
                paradigm which can provide virtually unlimited scalable high
                performance computing resources. Cloud workflows often underlie
                many large scale data/computation/instance intensive e-science,
                e-business and e-government applications. For cloud workflow
                systems to be High Confidence Software, one of the important
                issues is that workflows need to complete on time. This talk
                presents a temporal framework for timely completion of cloud
                workflows. It covers temporal constraint setting, temporal
                consistency state monitoring and temporal violation handling. In
                particular, the talk gives the details on cost-effective
                temporal checkpoint selection for consistency monitoring.    <br />

                  Title: Can We Just Change What We See on the Interface?<br />
                  <br />
                  Abstract: When an execution exposes a fault, it would be easy
                  for a developer to correct the buggy output on the interface
                  but difficult to correct the buggy code. Ideally, developers
                  would feel convenient to have a tool to automatically
                  propagate corrections on the output to the corresponding code.
                  However, it might be almost impossible to build such a tool in
                  general. In this talk, we demonstrate that we can build such a
                  tool in a special case. In particular, we demonstrate that we
                  can propagate corrections on the presentation of dynamic web
                  applications to the code generating the web pages. We further
                  argue that it should be worthwhile to dig more into this issue
                  and thus build more tools for other cases.<br />

                Title: Canonicalizing Execution for Automated Debugging   [<a href="debugging-ishcs11.pdf">Slides</a>]<br />
                <br />
                Abstract: In this talk, I will present an automated debugging
                technique. Given a failing run, it identifies the root cause and
                explains how it leads to the failure. It works by comparing the
                failing run with a passing reference run. The reference run
                could be acquired through a different program version, a
                different schedule, or a different input. The key to success is
                proper execution alignment before comparison. Executions may
                differ in many aspects: an instruction may be executed for
                different numbers of times due to the different numbers of loop
                iterations or recursions; memory layout may also diverge. Hence,
                they cannot be simply aligned by instructions and memory
                addresses. Comparison at mis-aligned places generates
                meaningless results. I will discuss two execution
                canonicalization primitives we developed over the years called
                Structural Indexing that allows execution alignment along the
                control flow dimension and Memory Indexing along the memory
                dimension.  <br />
                <br />
                Leveraging the two primitives, the automated debugging technique
                features robust and effective causality testing. That is, the
                technique is able to test if copying a subset of program state
                from the failing run and pasting it to the passing run induces
                the same failure in the passing run. Results show that the
                technique can compute very concise (less than 20 steps for most
                real world bugs including some from gcc) and effective (i.e.
                precisely explaining the failures) failure causal paths within
                minutes for most cases.<br />

                Title: Are Users' Misconfigurations Your Fault?<br />
                <br />
                Abstract: Configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) are
                among the dominant causes of system failures. But unfortunately,
                many developers think they are users faults and do not pay
                enough attention to design configuration requirement to make
                them it less prone to user mistakes. In addition, unlike
                software bugs,  misconfigurations are not recorded rigorously to
                retro-inspect how software can be improved to avoid or at least
                tolerate such misconfigurations.  In this talk, I will present
                our recent work on characterizing misconfigurations in both
                commercial and open source systems.  More specifically, we have
                studied a total of 546 real world misconfigurations, including
                309misconfigurations from a commercial storage system deployed
                at thousands of customers, and 237 from four widely used open
                source systems (CentOS, MySQL, Apache HTTP Server, and
                OpenLDAP). Our findings provide some useful guidelines for (1)
                software architects and developers to make their systems more
                user friendly as regards to configurations and (2) software
                engineering researchers and tool designers to design more
                effective test cases to check how a piece of software is
                tolerant to user misconfigurations.<br />

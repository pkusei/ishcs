              Title: You gave me too many knobs!<br/><br/> Abstract:
              Configuration problems are not only prevalent, but also
              severely impair the reliability of today’s systems and
              data centers. One fundamental reason is the
              ever-increasing complexity of configuration, reflected
              by the large number of configuration parameters
              (“knobs”). With hundreds of knobs, configuring system
              software to ensure high reliability and performance
              becomes a daunting, error-prone task. This paper makes a
              first step in understanding a fundamental question of
              configuration design: “do users (system admins) really
              need so many knobs?” To provide the quantitatively
              answer, we study the con- figuration settings of
              real-world users, including thousands of customers of a
              commercial storage system, and hundreds of users of two
              widely-used open-source system software projects. My
              talk will share our findings as well as the
              implications. <br/><br/>

Title: Side Channel Analysis Using a Model Counting Constraint Solver and Symbolic Execution<br/><br/>
Abstract: A crucial problem in software security is the detection of side-­channels. Information gained by observing non­functional properties of program executions (such as execution time or memory usage) can enable attackers to infer secret information (such as a password). In this talk, I will discuss how symbolic execution, combined with a model counting constraint solver, can be used for quantifying side­-channel leakage in Java programs. In addition to computing information leakage for a single run of a program, I will also discuss computation of information leakage for multiple runs for a type of side channels called segmented oracles. In segmented oracles, the attacker is able to explore each segment of a secret (for example each character of a password) independently. For segmented oracles, it is possible to compute information leakage for multiple runs using only the path constraints generated from a single run symbolic execution. These results have been implemented as an extension to the symbolic execution tool Symbolic Path Finder (SPF) using the SMT solver Z3 and two model counting constraint solvers LattE and ABC.<br/><br/>

Title: Understanding and Detecting Wake Lock Misuses for Android Applications<br/><br/>
Abstract: Wake locks are widely used in Android apps to protect critical computations from being disrupted by device sleeping. Inappropriate use of wake locks often seriously impacts user experience. However, little is known on how wake locks are used in real-world Android apps and the impact of their misuses. To bridge the gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on 44,736 commercial and 31 open-source Android apps. By automated program analysis and manual investigation, we observed (1) common program points where wake locks are acquired and released, (2) 13 types of critical computational tasks that are often protected by wake locks, and (3) eight patterns of wake lock misuses that commonly cause functional and non-functional issues, only three of which had been studied by existing work. Based on our ﬁndings, we designed a static analysis technique, Elite , to detect two most common patterns of wake lock misuses. Our experiments on real-world subjects showed that Elite is effective and can outperform two state-of-the-art techniques. We have also built a corpus on Android resource leakage issues from 124,214 code revisions of 34 large-scale open source Android apps. The corpus can facilitate future studies on leakage issues in Android apps.<br/><br/>

Title: Automated Bug Localization and Repair<br/><br/>
Abstract: Software systems and bugs are often inseparable. Many systems receive hundreds of bug reports daily which is often too many for developers to handle. Even for a single bug, debugging can be a costly process that consumes much of developer time and energy. To deal with these challenges, automated methods that can help developers locate buggy program elements and even repair them are needed.<br/>
In this talk, I will first share our recent works that help developers find buggy methods given symptoms of bugs, leveraging data analysis techniques. Next, I will share our solutions to automatically repair bugs including security vulnerabilities, by leveraging manually and automatically constructed knowledge bases. These techniques have been demonstrated to work with real bugs from medium to large software systems. At the end of this talk, several directions of future work, partly motivated by our empirical study with hundreds of practitioners, will be presented.<br/><br/>

Title: Are Mobile Operating Systems Ready for the Post-Smartphone Era?<br/><br/>
Abstract: While the smartphone market is still flourishing, we are quickly embracing a variety of new computing platforms, such as wearable devices, IoT, and virtual reality headsets. These platforms challenge multiple fundamental assumptions made by today’s system software. <br/>
This talk focuses on interactive wearable devices: they bring dramatic changes to apps and hardware, leaving operating system (OS) design in the mist. To this end, we thoroughly examine the execution efficiency of Android Wear, a popular wearable OS. By running a suite of fifteen benchmarks, we profile four system aspects: CPU usage, idle episodes, thread-level parallelism, and microarchitectural behaviors. We present the discovered inefficiencies and their root causes, together with a series of widespread, yet unknown OS design flaws. Our work has strong implications on future wearable OSes.<br/><br/>

Title: Enabling Fine-Grained Access Control for Android Apps<br/><br/>
Abstract: Many Android apps access sensitive personal data such as location and contacts. The current permission-based access control cannot control how sensitive might be used within the same app. For example, if an app obtains the permission to access location, it can use it for both navigation and advertisement. In my talk, I will present out recent work on how to infer the purpose of permission uses within an app, as well as how to provide fine-grained access control based on purposes and UI components.<br/><br/>

Title: Theory on the Structure and Coloring of Maximal Planar Graphs<br/><br/>
Abstract: In this talk, I will present an idea of proving the four-color conjecture. The basis is two recursion formulae of chromatic polynomial of a maximal planar graph G. These formulae will lead the study onto a special class of graphs. To characterize the properties of such class of graphs, a novel technique, “extending-contracting operation”, is proposed which can be used to construct maximal planar graphs. The essence of this technique is to study a special kind of configurations, domino configurations. Based on the extending-contracting operation, an idea of proving the uniquely 4-colorable maximal planar graph conjecture is proposed. This talk further addresses the Kempe equivalence of maximal planar graphs.<br/><br/>

Title: Locate software bugs: A machine learning perspective<br/><br/>
Abstract: Software Systems are becoming larger and more complex, which places a big challenge on software quality assurance because it is almost infeasible to conduct extensive code inspection or testing for every software module. Thus, software systems are usually shipped with bugs. Locating the defect-prone software modules effectively may help to improve the quality of the software system as well as the productivity of the developers. A plenty of models and approaches have been proposed for locating software bugs. However, some of them may not fully capture the data properties of software. In this talk, we will discuss several attempts to address the problem of locating software bugs from a machine learning perspective, where the properties of software data are carefully considered.
<br/><br/>Bio: Dr. Ming Li is currently an associate professor with the National Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University.

<br/><br/>Abstract: Open source projects are often supported by companies. Such involvement affects the robust contributor inflow needed to sustain the project and sometimes prompts key contributors to leave. To capture user innovation and to maintain quality of software and productivity of teams these projects need to attract and retain contributors. We try to understand and quantify how inflow and retention are shaped by policies and actions of companies in three application server projects. We identify three hybrid projects implementing the same JavaEE specification and use published literature, online materials, and interviews to quantify actions and policies companies used to get involved. We collect project repository data, analyze affiliation history of project participants, and use generalized linear models and survival analysis to measure contributor inflow and retention. We found that full control mechanisms and high intensity of commercial involvement were associated with a decrease of external inflow and with improved retention. However, a shared control mechanism was associated with increased external inflow contemporaneously with the increase of commercial involvement. The methods enable us to quantify aspects of the balance between community and private interests in open source software projects and provide clear implications to inform the structure of future open source communities.

</p><hr/><p id="XuanzheLiu"><b>Xuanzhe Liu</b>, Peking University, China</p><p>Title: Towards User-Friendly Mobile Web Computing
<br/><br/>Abstract: Web browsing is one of the most significant user requirements on mobile devices such as smartphones. However, the user experience of mobile web browsing is undesirably sluggish because of the slow resource loading. We made a comprehensive measurement study to uncover the resource update history and cache configurations at the server side, and analyze the cache performance in various time granularities. We investigate three main root causes: Same Content, Heuristic Expiration, and Conservative Expiration Time. Based on these findings, we have developed two solutions to mitigate the imperfect resource-loading performance from different aspects. At the programming abstraction level, we propose ReWAP, which is based on an efficient mechanism of resource packaging where stable resources are encapsulated and maintained into a package, and such a package shall be loaded always from the local storage and updated by explicitly refreshing. Compared to the original mobile Web apps with cache enabled, ReWAP can significantly reduce the data traffic, with the median saving up to 51%. In addition, ReWAP can incur only very minor runtime overhead of the client-side browsers. At the system level, we propose the SWAROVsky, a dual-proxy system that comprises a remote cloud-side proxy and a local proxy on mobile devices. Our system can be used with existing Web browsers and Web servers, and does not break the normal semantics of a webpage. Evaluations with 50 websites show that on average our system can reduce the page load time by 43.1% and the network data transmission by 57.6%, while imposing marginal system overhead.

<br/><br/>Abstract: With the great popularity of mobile devices, the amount of mobile apps has grown in a dramatic rate than we have ever expected. A technical challenge is how to evaluate the quality of mobile apps from the perspective of mobile users. In this talk, we present a study on the recommendation of mobile apps. The basic input of the problem is the existing user feedback available in mobile markets. Additionally, we identify a unique characteristic that exists in mobile app recommendation, i.e., an app usually corresponds to multiple release versions. We also propose methods to leverage the review text in user feedback, the app descriptions, and the social relationships between users. Experimental results on a Google Play data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

</p><hr/><p id="YangLiu"><b>Yang Liu</b>, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</p><p>Title: Vulnerability Analysis for Binary Programs
<br/><br/>Abstract: Software vulnerability is one of the major threats to software security. Vulnerability detection is essential for securing software systems from potential threats and adversaries, and various techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, none of these techniques can provide a complete solution to win the war against vulnerabilities. In this talk, we would like to introduce some initial attempts to solve this problem by (1) first focusing on the vulnerability patches to summarize vulnerability patterns and (2) then combining different techniques to confirm vulnerabilities. On one hand, vulnerabilities, once discovered, are often fixed by applying security patches. Therefore, security patches carry important information about vulnerabilities, which can be used to summarize the patterns of vulnerabilities that can be further used to discover, understand, and even fix (similar) vulnerabilities. On the other hand, once a potential vulnerability is discovered through matching vulnerability patterns, smarted fuzzing techniques need to be developed to confirm the vulnerabilities. We managed to find a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in proprietary software and demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution.
<br/><br/>Bio: Dr Liu Yang graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2010, he obtained his PhD and started his post doctoral work in NUS, MIT and SUTD.

In 2012 fall, he joined Nanyang Technological University as a Nanyang Assistant professor. He is currently the director of the cybersecurity lab in NTU.
Dr. Liu specializes in software verification, security and software engineering. His research has bridged the gap between the theory and practical usage of formal methods and program analysis to evaluate the design and implementation of software for high assurance and security. His work led to the development of a state-of-the-art model checker, Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT). This tool is used by research institutions in over 80 countries for research and education.

<br/><br/>Abstract: Debugging is expensive. Automatic program repair provides a one-stop service from bugs to patches. Test-suite based repair sounds useful and practical, but struggles for repairability and correctness. In this talk, I will present our recent work on test-suite based repair: how to repair conditional statements and how to enhance existing tests. In our work, we design semantic program synthesis to automatically fix conditional bugs. In program repair, a test suite is important to patch synthesis. We then introduce the enhancement of test suites via splitting existing tests. Our work aims to move towards better tests for better patches.

<br/><br/>Abstract: Multithreaded programs exhibit non-determinism and any unexpected interleaving may introduce concurrency bugs. To detect these bugs, random testing approaches do not provide any guarantee. Recently, PCT innovatively generates scheduling prior to program executions and provides a guarantee. However, PCT does not consider thread interaction and the features of concurrency bugs. We proposed RPro to restrict bug detection into a certain range with a radius. Hence, RPro provides a higher probabilistic guarantee than that by PCT theoretically and experimentally (when applying on deadlock detection). 
On the other hand, even a software product are well-tested, concurrency bugs may still occur after deployment. We then propose a light-weighted sampling approach to detect concurrency bugs (i.e., data race currently) at deployed products based on sampling and hardware utilizations. The experimental results confirmed that our proposal are highly deployable. That is, at 1% sampling rate, it only incurred 5% overhead on average.
